									<h4>My Background</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ncsu_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>I'm currently a student at NC State, where I begin in engineering. Although I still love the problem-solving engineering approach, I have since switched to statistics because I want to solve real-world problems through data analysis. The increasing presence of big data can either be a huge pain or a huge opportunity ...and I intend to help you transform the former into the latter! I'm passionate about helping both data-literate and non-data-literate people perform data-informed decisions.</p>
									<p>During my time at State, I've gained a solid statistical foundation that informs the lens through which I process and analyze data, supplemented by experience with statistical applications of coding languages, including Python, R, Java, and SAS.</p>
									<hr />
									
									<h4>My Experience</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/snowboard1_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was able to apply that knowledge most recently through an internship with the Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS), a partnership between the National Security Agency (NSA) and NC State, where I assisted in both quantitative and qualitative data analysis; in the former category falls the collection, transformation, and regression of Pew opinion data and geospatial data, and in the latter is a literature review and poster analyzing trust in the analytic space. In addition to the real-world application of skills I'd acquired mostly in theoretical, clean applications, I was excited by the interdisciplinary nature of working at LAS, which necessitated collaboration and added layers of meaning, background, and application to our data analysis.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/haiti_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>In high school, I enjoyed tutoring my friends when they needed help with classes, which propelled me to become a math tutor in college and thus recognize my enthusiasm for teaching, which in my career has translated to a desire to help both data-literate and non-data-literate audiences understand data analysis.</p>
									<hr />
									
									<h4>My Interests</h4>
									<p>One of my favorite parts of NC State is its diversity of clubs and organizations, a few of which I've come to be passionate about!</p>
									<d1>
										<dt><b>Antioch College Ministry</b></dt>
										<dd><p>Antioch has served as more than just an organization for me, but rather a family into which I was accepted with open arms. As a nervous freshman in need of a supportive community, encountering Antioch was transformative. It's now my delight to carry forward that legacy as I get to welcome new people into Antioch, which accepts them as they are while loving them enough to encourage growth.</p></dd>
										<dt><b>Deutschklub + Kaffeeklatsch</b></dt>
										<dd><p>My mother is a first-generation American whose parents are from Germany. As such, German culture and traditions (and a few words here and there) are integrated into my childhood, so learning German (and hopefully visiting Germany if covid-19 allows) is motivated by better understanding my family culture and especially my grandparents. Deutschklub at NC State has provided an experiental learning environment to supplement my classroom German education, along with Kaffeeklatsch (translation: coffee gossip) every week.</p></dd>
										<dt><b>Shag + Swing Dance</b></dt>
										<dd><p>I was first introduced to shag and swing dance through The Raleigh Shag Club hosted at TJ's, and the result has been a love for swing dance that has infected my friends to the point where we've coordinated swing dance events together!</p></dd>
