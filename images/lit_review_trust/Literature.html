Those who do have a realistic view of what it can and cannot do. They understand that intelligence is more helpful in detecting trends than in predicting specific events. They know how to ask questions that force intelligence specialist to separate what they actually know from what they think they know. They are not intimidated by intelligence that runs counter to the prevailing policy but see it as a useful jog to thinking about their courses of action.<br>-- Although both analysts need to learn &quot;what makes analysis helpful to policymakers and what does not&quot; and policymakers must better appreciate &quot;what analysis is and is not [and] what it can reasonably be expected to deliver and what it cannot&quot;, the &quot;larger burden must fall on the analyst community... the analyst as the provider of service has the responsibility to understand what is needed and the most effective way to present it.”<br>-- “In contrast to the fundamentally optimistic thrust of the policy culture, the culture of the intelligence world is marked by skepticism. The requirement to warn of dangers – and the heavy criticism when warning fails – encourages a darker view than is ever instinctively the case in the policy world.” “The battles in the analytic world always center on what things mean and not – as in the policy world – on what to do. ...Below I will discuss ways for intelligence officers to be helpful in such circumstances <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">while still observing the prohibition against prescribing policy.</span>&quot; Analysts can take a number of steps, well short of prescribing policy, to help policymakers think through choices. <br>      (1) Analysts can <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">use a series of conceptual approaches to help policymakers think through complex problems</span>, for example:<br>               -- Test the case: Use data to “test whether the policymaker’s theory of the case corresponds to reality as it appears to the analyst.” <br>               -- Provide pointers. <br>               -- Assess underlying forces.<br>      (2) Analysts can &quot;<span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">effectively warn of impending dangers</span>.” Beyond the “obvious focal points” of issues that threaten US citizens or military, “every analyst on every issue needs to bear in mind that what policymakers hate most is surprise. If they are surprised about key foreign developments, even when they do not involve life-and-death issues, it forces them into a more improvisational posture and increases the potential for policy error. ...In bringing such trends to the attention of the policy consumer, the intelligence officer must build in an <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">explicit statement of his or her underlying assumptions</span>. ...The analyst should understand explicitly what combination of evidence and logic leads him or her to this view and make that clear in the assessments that reach the policymaker.”<br>      (3) Analysts can &quot;<span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">point out opportunities</span>. ...chances are that policymakers will stop paying attention if the analyst never does anything but warn.” If the analyst is able to discern a helpful solution from their intelligence, “such an approach falls well short of prescribing policy and is one of the analytic achievements that policymakers appreciate most.

It is always best to alert policymakers to these differences and why they exist.”<br>-- “Finally, when analysts are generally confident of conclusions and are in a warning posture, it is important that what they present be persuasive. ...Analysts must do more than merely state their opinions. Their conclusions have to be laid out in a way that gives the policymaker transparency on many of the factors discussed above.” Without them to contribute to the persuasive quality of the argument, “the analyst risks having the policymaker dismiss his or her conclusions as a mere hunch or intuition.”</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[ <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">trust </span>intro ]<br><br>Actionable intelligence (help think through + point out opportunities, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">be persuasive when needed</span>)<br><br>Clarity<br><br>Transparency (underlying assumptions, be explicit about what&#39;s unknown, notify when a view has changed, level of confidence (including &quot;Accuracy&quot; point), persuasive when needed)<br><br>Fairness (&quot;alternative views&quot;)<br><br>Timeliness</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Analysts dealing with incomplete information possibly parallels journalists dealing with breaking news stories (see row 30 for &quot;A New Understanding&quot;), and thus it may apply that transparency of what&#39;s unknown covers the sometimes lack in accuracy or completeness. </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="710558275R43" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">44</div></th><td class="s13" dir="ltr">&gt;&gt; The Policymaker&#39;s Perspective: Transparency and Partnership<br><br>Chapter 5<a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QVSO8Yiq4nMC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=serving+the+national+policymaker+john+mclaughlin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JuKGaO9Vqn&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DKM0kchWwfrptQOOYMYVATAyVyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2oLT1g5DxAhXrFlkFHf6_CjkQ6AEwCXoECAcQAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">:</a><span style="color:#000000;"><a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QVSO8Yiq4nMC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=serving+the+national+policymaker+john+mclaughlin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JuKGaO9Vqn&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DKM0kchWwfrptQOOYMYVATAyVyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2oLT1g5DxAhXrFlkFHf6_CjkQ6AEwCXoECAcQAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> </a></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#1155cc;"><a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QVSO8Yiq4nMC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=serving+the+national+policymaker+john+mclaughlin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JuKGaO9Vqn&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DKM0kchWwfrptQOOYMYVATAyVyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2oLT1g5DxAhXrFlkFHf6_CjkQ6AEwCXoECAcQAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovatio</a></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#1155cc;">ns </span> </td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">IC</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">-- Tension between analysts and policymakers arises from policymakers&#39; unrealistic expectations, from the clash between the policymakers’ culture of optimism vs. the analysts’ culture of skepticism, and from policymakers’ view that the analytic community is too insulated from the “on the ground” reality. <br>-- 4 main approaches to ease this tension and build a constructive, collaborative relationship:<br>      (1) “The policymaker needs, and is entitled to, the IC’s best judgment.” It’s important for policymakers to understand “the <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">degree and nature of uncertainty</span> and, where possible, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">what steps might be taken to reduce that uncertainty</span>. ...Rather than blurring conclusions to achieve broader acceptance or relegating non-majority views to footnotes, finished analysis should <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">highlight the alternative views</span> within the intelligence community, and prominently feature the <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">proponents’ underlying arguments</span> for their conclusions.” While assigning numerical probabilities to individual events may provide a false sense of concreteness, “some sense of the degree of confidence (likely, unlikely, hard to judge, etc.) can give a feel for the degree of uncertainty.

By examining elements of an opponent’s society—like values, culture, and history—it puts political behavior into context, making its significance more clear. In addition to the depth of knowledge brought to conventional issues, the IC can go beyond political—and, in some cases, economic—analysis into “nontraditional” emerging issues like weapons proliferation, terrorism, and crime; a place where the IC can more easily distinguish itself and demonstrate a comparative advantage in intelligence analysis. It is in these areas that the IC can develop a <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">sound basis for </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">credibility </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">in the area of intelligence beyond the independent capacity of policymakers</span>.”<br>(2) Differences in cognitive processing: For analysts, &quot;one risky type of cognitive distortion is <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">mirror-imaging, or filling in missing information about an opponent with one’s own values, intentions, and motivations</span>. An analyst may instinctively project a personal perspective to fill in the intelligence gaps. This would ignore the opponent’s unique ideas and values that may constitute a different approach to an issue. The danger here is that people around the world have different cultures, and hence different perspectives.”<br>(3) Politicization: &quot;Analysts who carve out information to fit a specific outcome are guilty of upward politicization. Intelligence products cannot effectively support the policymaking process if they are not comprehensive products that includes all relevant intelligence. “Cherry-picking” evidence instead of including all available intelligence can both support and subvert a predetermined policy outcome, warping the standards of <span style="font-weight:bold;">objectivity</span>. In addition, intelligence professionals may let their own personal biases enter into many parts of the intelligence cycle, from tasking collection assets to synthesizing all-source intelligence into a final product.&quot;</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Accessibility (context),<br>Fairness (no mirror-imaging + no upward politicization + no cherry-picking) </td><td class="s11" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="710558275R47" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">48</div></th><td class="s17" dir="ltr">&gt;&gt; <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#1155cc;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/rgs_dissertations/RGSD186.html">The Impact of the Information Revolution on Policymakers’ Use of Intelligence Analysis</a></span></td><td class="s18" dir="ltr">IC</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">-- This report addresses what its title suggests and is mostly outdated by current standards.<br>-- The author analyzes policymakers’ personal attributes and preferences; he synthesizes several sources to state: “some decisionmakers may be more comfortable operating with <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">highly abstracted data while others might prefer to operate on unfiltered data</span> to make decisions and provide direction to subordinates.” Additionally, “policymakers may operate effectively with more or less data abstraction because ‘of their inherent intellectual and data processing capabilities.’ Typically, senior decisionmakers search for higher levels of abstraction than those at junior levels because senior officials have far greater areas of responsibility.”<br>-- The author divides policymakers using 3 different personality types as well as 3 different decisionmaking styles. The first distinction is as follows: (1) Type I decisionmakers might be the kind who seek out and solicit all-source information, but place selective filters on incoming information to prevent information overload, often asking suppliers a wide range of questions. (2) Type II decisionmakers make decisions in a “black box,” using very tight filters on incoming information, ignoring most of it, and basing their decisions more on instinct and past experience than new information. (3) Type III decisionmakers seek out as much information as possible, immersing themselves in data and analysis to be as best informed as possible before making a decision.<br>-- The second set of categories: “Some decisionmakers are rational or irrational in their decisionmaking. They can be quick, intuitive learners or they can be slow learners who have to work harder to grasp new concepts or environments.

In FTT, a stimulus is represented in two ways: gist (“meaning of the stimulus in context”) and verbatim (“detailed representation of the stimulus that retains its surface form”). The authors argue that the gist of analysis products are “often lost in official communications.” Analyses often “require significant domain expertise and may rely heavily on mathematical models, expert judgment, and inference from a wide variety of data sources to inform decisions.” Therefore, while analysis products that include several verbatim details (but lack sufficient context) may be interpretable to analysts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">policymakers tend to not be aware of the “methods and assumptions underlying these analyses” and therefore may draw incorrect inferences</span>, “missing the proverbial forest (gist) for the trees (verbatim).”<br>-- “Meaningfulness is not the same as detailed information—an analysis product may contain many details that are insignificant for the purposes of decision making.”<br>--  Supported by empirical evidence, the authors argue that “gist-based interventions that <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">communicate the bottom-line meaning of options to decision makers</span>, rather than reliance upon verbatim statistical communication, more effectively predict decision outcomes.”<br>-- Five resulting policy recommendations are provided: <br>      (1) Beyond simply providing decision makers with more details, communicators should aim to express the gist of an analysis product—that is, its meaning in context. Absent such context, any detailed information may be prone to misinterpretation. <br>      (2) Several gists are possible, and not all are informed. Gists should, therefore, be elicited from experts in relevant domains. <br>Whereas experts are more likely to rely on informed gist representations, nonexperts may either use brittle rote verbatim rules or inappropriate gist representations when evaluating analysis products. Therefore, when choosing gists to express to policy makers, communicators should verify that these gists are consistent with those held by domain experts. <br>In addition, several special circumstances may also apply to the intelligence community, including sensitivities around communicating classified information. Here, gist communication would be especially effective because an analyst who is “read in” to a specific program may be able to effectively communicate the gist of a specific analysis product without necessarily revealing sensitive sources and methods.<br>      (3) When gists from different sources of expertise do not agree, communicators should seek an overarching integrative gist. <br>      (4) Details, when communicated, should be explicitly linked to corresponding categorical gists.<br>Unlike standard cost–benefit analyses, options are likely to be more comprehensible to decision makers if they are communicated in gist categories—that is, likelihoods may be characterized as <span style="font-style:italic;">possible </span>or <span style="font-style:italic;">essentially nil chance</span>, with the latter category only emphasized if they&#39;re &quot;sufficiently catastrophic&quot; or &quot;high-impact low probability events.&quot; <br>FTT predicts that multiple representations are encoded in parallel, and that these representations are distinct. People may hold conflicting representations of a stimulus in memory without recognizing the logical discrepancy. Thus, people may encode verbatim details but may not change overall gists. However, details can be more compelling if they are linked to a categorical gist.<br>      (5) Individuals who excel at gist communication and translation should be identified, trained, and retained. <br>-- &quot;The costs of implementing such a scientific approach to gist communication would be minimal: the intelligence enterprise already recognizes the value of “Bottom Line Up Front” (BLUF) communications when executing policy briefs; however, this approach is primarily heuristic. In contrast, FTT offers an approach grounded in replicable scientific theory with specific criteria that may be used to evaluate the extent to which a given message does indeed communicate a coherent gist.&quot;<br>-- Among a number of remaining questions the authors posed is this: “What is the appropriate combination of bottom-line gist and verbatim detail that effectively communicates an analysis product while also establishing the communicator’s credibility?”</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Accessibility?<br><br>Transparency (helping policymakers draw correct inferences by understanding underlying methods and assumptions)</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Look into &quot;risk communication&quot; in relation to journalism/IC.<br><br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="710558275R51" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">52</div></th><td class="s13" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/09_intelligence_community_lieberthal.pdf">The U.S. Intelligence Community and Foreign Policy: Getting Analysis Right</a></td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">IC</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">-- Identified systematic weaknesses in analytical products:<br>     -- Products not well suited to the actual practical needs of many policymakers  <br>     -- Analytic risk aversion that leads to products that try to present all of the pertinent sources of information but lack analytic depth and conceptual strength<br>     -- Failure to integrate adequately information that resides in different parts of the analytical community  <br>     -- Using streams of information without sufficient appreciation of pertinent context—political, bureaucratic, social, and cultural<br>-- 2 recommendations of 5 to improve the utility of IC analytical products for policymakers: <br>       (1) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Develop regular feedback mechanisms from the policymaker to analysts</span> – Periodic meetings can greatly help the IC understand the look-ahead intelligence requirements of policymakers and garner critical feedback on materials sent over since the last such meeting.  <br>       (2) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Train analysts in the power dynamic between analysts and policymakers</span> – &quot;The desire of analysts to please the most senior intelligence consumers who are driving to a decision based, in part, on intelligence judgment can lead analysts unintentionally to overstate their confidence in the intelligence.

The desire of the analysts to please the most senior intelligence consumers who were driving to a decision based, in part, on the intelligence judgments typically led the analysts to overstate their confidence in the intelligence.

Both demands pose dangers. To wait for all information to be complete and verified before releasing it to the public can create an information vacuum that will almost certainly be filled with rumor and speculation. To release information that has not been double-checked and which turns out to be inaccurate, however, runs the risk of misleading the public and <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">undermining your credibility</span> as a spokesperson. The best way to address this challenge is to <span style="font-weight:bold;">establish regular briefings with the media </span>at which time all information can be delivered, explained, and updated. <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">If information is an estimation, it can be presented as such and its preliminary nature stressed</span> to the media. This approach... keeps information in its proper context and prevents it from becoming etched in stone [and it] keeps the media attentive to the changing nature of the issue.” Tips for updating the media:<br>     -- Be prepared to explain the meaning behind evolving information<br>     -- If you suspect that the next information update will drastically change a story, give reporters a sense that such may be the case. <br>     -- Always know how information was gathered and conclusions reached.<br>-- Scientific information will be more useful to the audience and greater communication success will be achieved if the information provided is relevant and easily understood (Frewer, 1999; and Bean, 1988). To help audiences understand the issues, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">create well-targeted messages [and] use clear, non-technical language</span> to discuss risks. Ways to better communicate complex scientific or technical information: <br>     -- <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Use consistent names and other terms</span> throughout a crisis situation (e.g., don’t switch from ppm to ppb).<br>     -- <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Avoid acronyms and jargon and provide careful definitions</span> in advance. <br>     -- Carefully consider what types of visuals the news media may want, be sure all information is explained fully, and use these visuals to clarify and support key points.<br>     -- Use familiar frames of reference to explain how much, how big or how small. However, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">examples should not be trite or condescending or overly dramatic</span>. Take the time to develop meaningful examples and calculations.<br>     -- <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Indicate the level of certainty</span> of your information.<br>-- Acknowledging Uncertainty: Recognizing and admitting uncertainty is simply the reality of most risk communication situations. Unfortunately, scientific uncertainty is a complicating point in satisfying the public’s demand for reliable and meaningful information for many hazards and risks. <br>     -- If information is not known or not available, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">the best thing to do is to honestly admit it</span>.<br>     -- <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Saying “I don’t know” is an acceptable response and can actually build </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">credibility</span>. <br>     -- Audiences need to be provided as much information as possible to help them understand that uncertainty is part of the process and that the answers available now may not be the final answers. <br>-- Key factors in assessing trust and credibility are: empathy and caring; competence and expertise; honesty and openness; and dedication and commitment (Covello, 1992; Covello, 1993). 5 Rules for <span style="font-weight:bold;">Building Trust and Credibility</span> (Covello and Allen, 1988):<br>      (1) Accept and involve the public as a partner. <br>      (2) Appreciate the public’s specific concerns.<br>      (3) Be honest and open. <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Once lost, trust and credibility are almost impossible to regain.</span> Never mislead the public by lying or failing to provide information that is important to their understanding of issues. <br>      (4) Work with other credible sources. Conflicts and disagreements among organizations and credible spokespersons create confusion and breed distrust.<br>      (5) Meet the needs of the media. Never refuse to work with the media. The media’s role is to inform the public, which will be done with or without your assistance.<br>-- Media interview: “Do not worry about looking stupid. If you are confused by a question, say so. If you say something that’s wrong, or misstate a fact, don’t defend it, admit your error.”</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Timeliness balanced with later Accuracy<br><br>Transparency (present estimated info as such, admit if information is not known/available, indicate level of certainty)<br><br>Accessibility (clear, non-technical language + no jargon + define terms)</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">In comparing public officials communicating risk to analysts communicating with policymakers (especially during a high-pressure scenario or a crisis), some things match up:<br><br>The motivations differ: public officials want to inform the public without unnecessarily alarming them, while analysts want to inform policymakers in a timely manner while explaining themselves well.

Guide</a></td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Govt / Risk Communication</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">-- This report brings up many communication problems applicable to the IC, although not many accompanying solutions are provided.<br>-- 3 potential goals in risk communication: (1) just state the info, (2) change beliefs, or (3) change behavior<br>-- Communicator factors are discussed: Evidence suggests that an audience is most likely to believe sources that they perceive to be credible (expert, trustworthy, and concerned about the audience’s interests), likeable, appealing, and similar to them.<br>-- The point is made that precision and understandability must be balanced. The FDA&#39;s guidance is &quot;subject to nuanced constraints often clear only to those with scientific or legal training. The precision sought by scientists and attorneys who are the backbone of FDA as a science-driven regulatory agency can result in highly caveated statements. Unfortunately, providing a large quantity of information does not lend itself to effective communication. In fact, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">communicating multiple caveats and uncertainties can dilute a message</span> to the point of cognitive inaccessibility. From a perceptual perspective, the proliferation of caveats about uncertainties can result in discrediting the decisions to which they are so carefully applied.&quot;<br>-- Similar to IC agencies, the FDA points out that, &quot;<span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">if the public does not see FDA as trusted and credible, its communications will be less effective — even if all its practices and procedures are solidly evidence-based.</span>&quot;</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Transparency (don&#39;t include every caveat ever)<br><br>[ trust intro ]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="710558275R62" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">63</div></th><td class="s13" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/7338">Credibility and Trust in Risk Communication</a></td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">Risk Communication</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">-- Provides definitions of trust, confidence, and credibility. <br>-- Their 5 components of trust, amalgamated from the available literature, are: <br>       (1) Perceived competence (degree of technical expertise assigned to a message or a source)<br>       (2) <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Objectivity </span>(lack of biases in information as perceived by others)<br>       (3) <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Fairness </span>(acknowledgement and adequate representation of all relevant points of view)<br>       (4) Consistency (predictability of arguments and behavior based on past experience and previous communication efforts)<br>       (5) Faith (perception of &quot;good will&quot; in composing information)<br>-- Factors of Credibility for a Message:<br>       -- Positive: <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Timely disclosure of relevant information</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Regular updating with accurate information</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Clear and concise</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Unbiased</span>, Sensitive to values + fears + concerns of public, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Admits uncertainty</span>, From a legitimate reputable source, Organized message, Use of metaphors, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Explicit conclusions</span>, Positive information recorded in early part of message, Forceful and intense<br>      -- Negative: Stalled or delayed reporting, Inconsistent updating, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Full of Jargon</span>, Biased, Inconsiderate of public perception, The absolute truth, From a questionable source, Too literal, Receiver derive own conclusion, Dull <br>-- Factors of Credibility for a Person:<br>      -- Positive: Admits uncertainty, Responds to emotions of public, Appears competent, Similarity with receiver, Has some personal stake in the issue, Clear and concise, Perceived as &quot;expert&quot;, Perceived as &quot;attractive&quot;, Charismatic, Trustworthy-honest, altruistic, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">objective</span><br>      -- Negative: Cockiness, Indifference, Perceived as outsider, <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Too technical</span><br>-- &quot;Components such as competence, objectivity, neutrality, and faith are major building blocks for creating a trustful relationship.&quot;<br>-- Consistency matters: &quot;First, and most important, credibility of a communication source is closely linked to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">perceived past performance record</span>.&quot;</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[ definitions ]<br>Timeliness<br>Accuracy<br>Accessibility (clear + concise, not too technical, no jargon)<br>Fairness (objectivity, unbiased)<br>Transparency (admit uncertainty)<br>Consistency (past performance)</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr"><br><br>Many standards for trust are provided here!

But if you fail to &quot;be credible,&quot; you will virtually guarantee community opposition</span>, in the form of both disagreement with the science and resentment of the agency.&quot;<br>-- They identify trust in an agency as depending on whether the agency: (1) seems competent; (2) seems caring; (3) encourages meaningful public involvement; (4) seems honorable and honest; and (5) takes into account the &quot;outrage factors&quot; which influence perception of risk. <br>-- To build trust, admit you were wrong and be willing to say you don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t use all professional jargon and also don&#39;t &quot;simplify [it] so completely that you leave out important information.&quot;<br>-- On the balance of accuracy and timeliness: &quot;This guide is not suggesting releasing information without forethought and planning. We are suggesting that you consider releasing the data if you trust them, and if you have developed some management options or a process leading to development of options.
